            <p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</p>

        <div class="para1"> <p class="yt">C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top four languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages. In C, all executable code is contained within subroutines (also called "functions", though not in the sense of functional programming). Function parameters are passed by value, although arrays are passed as pointers, i.e. the address of the first item in the array. </p>

    <p class="para2"> C is a procedural language that supports structured programming; it has a static system and a compiler written in C itself. Since its release, C has become a milestone in computing history and has become the most critical component throughout the computer industry. Because C works very closely with the processor, performance-critical applications are mostly written in C, and because of its unmatched popularity programming languages derived a familiar C-style syntax along with the set of constructs that came with C (e.g., pointers, macros, etc.).</p>
